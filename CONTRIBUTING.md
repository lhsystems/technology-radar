## Branching
- Always create branches for your work
- Branch names should suggest the change, and contain lowercase alphanumerical characters, or the minus sign (-), eg: `hold-oracle-db` is a correct branch name, but `blabla/meaningless_info` is not

## Commits
- Please provide meaningful commit messages next to your commit, in English present term, eg: "Move Oracle DB to the hold ring" is a meaningful and valid commit message
- Avoid past term in the commit messages, keep the history consistent
- Multiline commit messages are permitted, with the restriction that the first line shall always be a meaningful, English sentence, using present term
- Multiple smaller commits are preferred over huge commits

## Pull Requests
- If possible, associate your Pull Request with an existing issue
- Keep your PR's small, and focus them on one change
- Describe the changes inside the PR description
- If a revier asks for changes, please mark it as resolved after it has been addressed
- PR's with unresolved issues will not be merged

## General rules for text files
- Use UTF-8 file encoding
- Use unix-style line-endings (single "\n" sequence at the end of the line)
- Aside from the line terminator sequence, the ASCII horizontal space character (0x20) is the only whitespace character that appears anywhere in a source file. This implies that:
    - All other whitespace characters in string and character literals are escaped
    - Tab characters are not used for indentation.
- Add newline at the end of every file
